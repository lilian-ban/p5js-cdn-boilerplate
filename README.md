# p5js-cdn-boilerplate

This boilerplate has been created to experiment and build small generative code with p5js
p5 is loaded with CDN which means that it might not be updated to the **last** version.

## To use it

There is two options on how to use it but first go into a terminal and then make your way to your file then :

**FIRST**

run `npm install`


**THEN**

to run it only with sass compiling & lint `npm run watch`

**OR**

to run it with sass compiling & local server you need two terminals :
1. on with `npm run watch`
2. the other one with `npm run server` which will launch and open a local server
